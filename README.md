This project describes the development of a building energy management system for the optimization of local energy communities energy resources, and demonstrations tests conducted at HSB Living Lab, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. The entire project involves energy resources optimization demonstrated at the pilot site (HSB Living Lab) using three test case: cost reduction, CO2 reduction and Self Consumption increase. However, due to data privacy, only the autarky increase simulation script is attached here. The simulation test cut across four seasons of the year: fall, winter, spring and summer.
